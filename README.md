# Goal

Make a tic-tac-toe game, with undo and redo.

I use [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) as incpiration.

In addition I want to add:

1. when a player winds, highlight the 3 squares that caused the win
2. on a draw, display the message that the game ended in a draw.

## Other considerations:

In first implementation:

- use javascript and jsx, not typescript
- use regular css, not sass
- write no tests
